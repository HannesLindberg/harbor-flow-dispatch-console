Design notes
------------
- Used clear() function to make the UI clean. 
- Also used if statement to make clear() function cross-platform for windows, mac and linux

Main function boundaries:

How input validation is organized:
- Used while loop for easy validations and try-except loop for complex validations
- Put validation loop inside the cases so after every invalid input, just the effected part will be repeat.

How shared calculations are reused:
- Created a calculation function called "calculate_delivery_quote".
- Reused it to calculate the quote variable in Task 3.
- Reused it to calculate the standard, express, and priority variables in Task 9.

Known limitations
-----------------
There are no Limitations.
